var texFile = "file.txt";
var file = new File (textFile);

file.open("r");
var str="";
while (!file.epf){

    //read each line of text
    str += file.readln()


file.close();
alert(str);


    switch (names){
    case "bob":
	console.log('boy');
    case "alicia":
	console.log('girl');
    case "cookie":
	console.log('dog');
    default:
	console.log('unknown');
	
    }

}


In my project, I need to sort out a list in a file.txt file contains different words. I need my program to recognize this 3 names : bob, alicia and cookie. And each time when he found for exemple "cookie" I want to display "dog" as a result, for "alicia" "girl" and for "bob" "boy" and for an other word "unknown".
